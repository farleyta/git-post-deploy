# .git POST deploy

A set of small scripts to manage the automatic pulling from a hosted .git repo on commit.

## Summary

Hosted .git repository services like [github](http://github.com) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) offer `POST` services that allow you run personally-hosted scripts after one of your hosted repositories is updated.  The file *deploy.php* (and the accompanying `DeployClass.php` file) should be uploaded to your personal server and set up to be called after your hosted repository is committed to.  The files in the `pre-deployment` directory are meant to be used just once, during the initial setup of the repo on your server â€“ they are opinionated files and may not be suitable for everyone, but they work for us and make our lives a little easier...

## How to Use

Still need to set this part up with a better description...

### Deployment

Description here of how to use deploy.php and DeployClass.php.

### Initial Pre-Deployment setup

Description of the initial setup process and options here.

## WARNING!

These scripts were created and tested with our server setup in mind, and although we haven't experienced any issues there are some potentially destructive command-line executions that have the potential to really screw up your specific server setup.  Please use with caution, make backups, and remember that we make no gaurantees and cannot be held responsible for any issues that arise with your use of these scripts!
